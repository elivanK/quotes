# Quotes - code challange

* Step 1 -  Use symfony latest version and upload the project to GitHab. The URL /api/motd will display a random quote of famous developers from json file. Git-Tag as version 1.0.0.

* Step 2 - Save the random quote in a database via ORM doctrine, the migrations via CLI. Git-Tag as version 2.0.0. It's not pretty but it works (if it's not broken - don't need to fix it).
